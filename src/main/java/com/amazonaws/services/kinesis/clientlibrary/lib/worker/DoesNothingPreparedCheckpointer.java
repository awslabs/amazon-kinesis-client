/**
 * A special IPreparedCheckpointer that does nothing, which can be used when preparing a checkpoint at the current
 * checkpoint sequence number where it is never necessary to do another checkpoint.
 * This simplifies programming by preventing application developers from having to reason about whether
 * their application has processed records before calling prepareCheckpoint
 *
 * Here's why it's safe to do nothing:
 * The only way to checkpoint at current checkpoint value is to have a record processor that gets
 * initialized, processes 0 records, then calls prepareCheckpoint(). The value in the table is the same, so there's
 * no reason to overwrite it with another copy of itself.
