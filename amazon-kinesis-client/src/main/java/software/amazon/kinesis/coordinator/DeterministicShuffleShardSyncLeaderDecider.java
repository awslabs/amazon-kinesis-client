/**
 * An implementation of the {@code LeaderDecider} to elect leader(s) based on workerId.
 * Leases are shuffled using a predetermined constant seed so that lease ordering is
 * preserved across workers.
 * This reduces the probability of choosing the leader workers co-located on the same
 * host in case workerId starts with a common string (e.g. IP Address).
 * Hence if a host has 3 workers, IPADDRESS_Worker1, IPADDRESS_Worker2, and IPADDRESS_Worker3,
 * we don't end up choosing all 3 for shard sync as a result of natural ordering of Strings.
 * This ensures redundancy for shard-sync during host failures.
