/**
 * This class contains data pertaining to a Lease. Distributed systems may use leases to partition work across a
 * fleet of workers. Each unit of work (identified by a leaseKey) has a corresponding Lease. Every worker will contend
 * for all leases - only one worker will successfully take each one. The worker should hold the lease until it is ready to stop
 * processing the corresponding unit of work, or until it fails. When the worker stops holding the lease, another worker will
 * take and hold the lease.
