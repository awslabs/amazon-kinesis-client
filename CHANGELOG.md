  * `--properties-file`: Properties file that the KCL should use to set up the Scheduler.
  * `--log-configuration`: logback.xml that the KCL should use for logging.
* Updated AWS SDK dependency to 2.2.0.
* MultiLangDaemon now uses logback for logging.

### Release 2.0.5 (November 12, 2018)
[Milestone #26](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/26?closed=1)
* Fixed a deadlock condition that could occur when using the polling model.  
  When using the `PollingConfig` and a slower record processor it was possible to hit a deadlock in the retrieval of records. 
  * [PR #462](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/462)
  * [Issue #448](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/448)
* Adjusted `RetrievalConfig`, and `FanOutConfig` to use accessors instead of direct member access.  
  * [PR #453](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/453)


### Release 2.0.4 (October 18, 2018)
[Milestone #25](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/25)
* Added method to retrieve leases from the LeaseCoordinator and LeaseTaker.
  * [PR #428](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/428)
* Fixed a race condition shutting down the Scheduler before it has completed initialization.
  * [PR #439](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/439)
  * [Issue #427](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/427)
* Added `HierarchicalShardSyncer` which replaces the static `ShardSyncer`.  
  `HierarchicalShardSyncer` removes the contention between multiple instances of the Scheduler when running under a single JVM.
  * [PR #395](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/395)
  * [Issue #415](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/415)
* Added `TaskExecutionListener` which allows monitoring of tasks being executed by the `ShardConsumer`.  
  The listener is invoked before and after a task is executed by the `ShardConsumer`.
  * [PR #417](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/417)

### Release 2.0.3 (October 8, 2018)
[Milestone #23](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/23)
* Fixed an issue where the `KinesisAsyncClient` could be misconfigured to use HTTP 1.1.  
  Using HTTP 1.1 with `SubscribeToShard` is unsupported, and could cause misdelivery of records to the record processor.  
  * [Issue #391](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/391)
  * [PR #434](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/434)
  * [PR #433](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/433)
* Lower the severity of `ReadTimeout` exceptions.  
  `ReadTimeout` exceptions can occur if the client is unable to request data from Kinesis for more than client timeout, which defaults to 30 seconds.  This can occur if the record processor blocks for more than the timeout period.  `ReadTimeout` could also occur as part of [Issue #391](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/391).  
  * [Issue #399](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/399)
  * [PR #403](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/403)
* Added a callback that allows applications to take actions after DynamoDB table creation.  
  Applications can now install a callback that is called after creating the DynamoDB table by implementing `TableCreatorCallback`.  
  * [PR #413](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/413)
* Updated the guava dependency to 26.0-jre.  
  * [PR #420](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/420)
  * [Issue #416](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/416)
* Added some additional debug logging around the initialization of the `FanOutRecordsPublisher`.  
  * [PR #398](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/398)
* Upgraded AWS SDK version to 2.0.6  
  * [PR #434](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/434)


### Release 2.0.2 (September 4, 2018)
[Milestone #22](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/22)
* Fixed an issue where the a warning would be logged every second if `logWarningForTaskAfterMillis` was set.  
  The logging for last time of data arrival now respects the value of `logWarningForTaskAfterMillis`.  
  * [PR #383](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/383)
  * [Issue #381](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/381)
* Moved creation of `WorkerStateChangedListener` and `GracefulShutdownCoordinator` to the `CoordinatorConfig`.
  Originally the `WorkerStateChangedListener` and `GracefulShutdownCoordinator` were created by methods on the `SchedulerCoordinatorFactory`, but they should have been configuration options.  
  The original methods have been deprecated, and may be removed at a later date.  
  * [PR #385](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/385)
  * [PR #388](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/388)
* Removed dependency on Apache Commons Lang 2.6.  
  The dependency on Apache Commons Lang 2.6 has removed, and all usages updated to use Apache Commons Lang 3.7.  
  * [PR #386](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/386)
  * [Issue #370](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/370)
* Fixed a typo in the MutliLang Daemon shutdown hook.  
  * [PR #387](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/387)
* Added method `onAllInitializationAttemptsFailed(Throwable)` to `WorkerStateChangedListener` to report when all initialization attempts have failed.  
  This method is a default method, and it isn't require to implement the method. This method is only called after all attempts to initialize the `Scheduler` have failed.
  * [PR #369](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/369)

### Release 2.0.1 (August 21, 2018)
* Mark certain internal components with `@KinesisClientInternalApi` attribute.  
  Components marked as internal may be deprecated at a faster rate than public components.  
  * [PR #358](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/358)
* Fixed an issue where `ResourceNotFoundException` on subscription to a shard was not triggering end of shard handling.  
  If a lease table contains a shard that is no longer present in the stream attempt to subscribe to that shard will trigger a `ResourceNotFoundException`. These exception are treated the same as reaching the end of a shard.
  * [PR #359](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/359)
* Fixed an issue where the KCL would not Use the configured DynamoDB IOPs when creating the lease table.  
  * [PR #360](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/360)
* Make the maximum number of Scheduler initialization attempts configurable.  
  The maximum number of `Scheduler` initialization attempts can be configured via `CoordinatorConfig#maxInitializationAttempts`.
  * [PR #363](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/363)
  * [PR #368](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/368)
* Fixed an issue where it was possible to get a duplicate record when resubscribing to a shard.  
  Subscribe to shard requires periodic resubscribing, and uses a new concept of a continuation sequence number.  If the continuation sequence number was equal to the last record that record would be processed a second time.  Resubscribing now uses `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to ensure that only later records are returned.  
  * [PR #371](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/371)
* Upgraded to AWS SDK 2.0.1  
  * [PR #372](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/372)
* Fixed an issue where time based restart of the subscription wasn't resetting the `lastRequestTime`.  
  If a subscription hasn't delivered any data for more than 30 seconds it will be canceled and restarted.  This detection is based of the `lastRequestTime` which wasn't getting reset after the restart was triggered.
  * [PR #373](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/373)
* Fixed an issue where requesting on the subscription from the `FanOutRecordsPublisher` could trigger an unexpected failure.  
  Due to a race condition the underlying flow in the subscription could be set to something else.  The method is now synchronized, and verifies that the subscriber it was created with is still the subscriber in affect.  
  This issue generally would only appear when multiple errors were occurring while connecting to Kinesis.
  * [PR #374](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/374)
* Fixed an issue where the number of requested items could exceed the capacity of the RxJava queue.  
  There was an off by one issue when determining whether to make a request to the SDK subscription.  This changes the calculation to represent the capacity as a queue.
  * [PR #375](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/375)

### Release 2.0.0 (August 02, 2018)
* The Maven `groupId`, along with the `version`, for the Amazon Kinesis Client has changed from `com.amazonaws` to `software.amazon.kinesis`.  
  To add a dependency on the new version of the Amazon Kinesis Client:  
  ``` xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.kinesis</groupId>
      <artifactId>amazon-kinesis-client</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
* Added support for Enhanced Fan Out.  
  Enhanced Fan Out provides for lower end to end latency, and increased number of consumers per stream. 
  * Records are now delivered via streaming, reducing end-to-end latency.
  * The Amazon Kinesis Client will automatically register a new consumer if required.  
    When registering a new consumer, the Kinesis Client will default to the application name unless configured otherwise.
  * `SubscribeToShard` maintains long lived connections with Kinesis, which in the AWS Java SDK 2.0 is limited by default.  
    The `KinesisClientUtil` has been added to assist configuring the `maxConcurrency` of the `KinesisAsyncClient`.   
    __WARNING: The Amazon Kinesis Client may see significantly increased latency, unless the `KinesisAsyncClient` is configured to have a `maxConcurrency` high enough to allow all leases plus additional usages of the `KinesisAsyncClient`.__
  * The Amazon Kinesis Client now uses 3 additional Kinesis API's:  
    __WARNING: If using a restrictive Kinesis IAM policy you may need to add the following API methods to the policy.__  
    * [`SubscribeToShard`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_SubscribeToShard.html)
    * [`DescribeStreamSummary`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeStreamSummary.html)
    * [`DescribeStreamConsumer`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeStreamConsumer.html)
    * [`RegisterStreamConsumer`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterStreamConsumer.html)
  * New configuration options are available to configure Enhanced Fan Out.

  | applicationName | Unset   | The name of the application.  This is used as the name of the consumer unless consumerName is set.                  |

* Modular Configuration of the Kinesis Client
  The Kinesis Client has migrated to a modular configuration system, and the `KinesisClientLibConfiguration` class has been removed.  
  Configuration has been split into 7 classes.  Default versions of the configuration can be created from the `ConfigsBuilder`.  
  Please [see the migration guide for more information][migration-guide].
  * `CheckpointConfig`
  * `CoordinatorConfig`
  * `LeaseManagementConfig`
  * `LifecycleConfig`
  * `MetricsConfig`
  * `ProcessorConfig`
  * `RetrievalConfig`

* Upgraded to AWS Java SDK 2.0  
  The Kinesis Client now uses the AWS Java SDK 2.0.  The dependency on AWS Java SDK 1.11 has been removed. 
  All configurations will only accept 2.0 clients.  
  * When configuring the `KinesisAsyncClient` the `KinesisClientUtil#createKinesisAsyncClient` can be used to configure the Kinesis Client 
  * __If you need support for AWS Java SDK 1.11 you will need to add a direct dependency.__  
    __When adding a dependency you must ensure that the 1.11 versions of Jackson dependencies are excluded__  
    [Please see the migration guide for more information][migration-guide]
    
* MultiLangDaemon is now a separate module  
  The MultiLangDaemon has been separated to its own Maven module and is no longer available in `amazon-kinesis-client`.  To include the MultiLangDaemon, add a dependency on `amazon-kinesis-client-multilang`.

## Release 1.9.1 (April 30, 2018)
* Added the ability to create a prepared checkpoint when at `SHARD_END`.
  * [PR #301](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/301)
* Added the ability to subscribe to worker state change events.  
  * [PR #291](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/291)
* Added support for custom lease managers.  
  A custom `LeaseManager` can be provided to `Worker.Builder` that will be used to provide lease services. 
  This makes it possible to implement custom lease management systems in addition to the default DynamoDB system.  
  * [PR #297](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/297)
* Updated the version of the AWS Java SDK to 1.11.219

## Release 1.9.0 (February 6, 2018)
* Introducing support for ListShards API. This API is used in place of DescribeStream API to provide more throughput during ShardSyncTask. Please consult the [AWS Documentation for ListShards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_ListShards.html) for more information.
  * ListShards supports higher call rate, which should reduce instances of throttling when attempting to synchronize the shard list.
  * __WARNING: `ListShards` is a new API, and may require updating any explicit IAM policies__
  * Added configuration parameters for ListShards usage
  
  | Name | Default | Description |
  | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
  | [listShardsBackoffTimeInMillis](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/3ae916c5fcdccd6b835c86ba7f6f53dd5b4c8b04/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1412) | 1500 ms | This is the default backoff time between 2 ListShards calls when throttled. |
  | [listShardsRetryAttempts](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/3ae916c5fcdccd6b835c86ba7f6f53dd5b4c8b04/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1423) | 50 | This is the maximum number of times the KinesisProxy will retry to make ListShards calls on being throttled. |
  
* Updating the version of AWS Java SDK to 1.11.272.

  * [PR #256](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/256)

## Release 1.8.6
* Add prefetching of records from Kinesis  
  Prefetching will retrieve and queue additional records from Kinesis while the application is processing existing records.  
  Prefetching can be enabled by setting [`dataFetchingStrategy`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1317) to `PREFETCH_CACHED`. Once enabled an additional fetching thread will be started to retrieve records from Kinesis. Retrieved records will be held in a queue until the application is ready to process them.  
  Pre-fetching supports the following configuration values:  
  
  | Name | Default | Description |
  | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
  | [`dataFetchingStrategy`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1317) | `DEFAULT` | Which data fetching strategy to use |
  | [`maxPendingProcessRecordsInput`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1296) | 3 | The maximum number of process records input that can be queued |
  | [`maxCacheByteSize`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1307) | 8 MiB | The maximum number of bytes that can be queued |
  | [`maxRecordsCount`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1326) | 30,000 | The maximum number of records that can be queued |
  | [`idleMillisBetweenCalls`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L1353) | 1,500 ms | The amount of time to wait between calls to Kinesis |
  
  * [PR #246](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/246)

## Release 1.8.5 (September 26, 2017)
* Only advance the shard iterator for the accepted response.  
  This fixes a race condition in the `KinesisDataFetcher` when it's being used to make asynchronous requests.  The shard iterator is now only advanced when the retriever calls `DataFetcherResult#accept()`.
  * [PR #230](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/230)
  * [Issue #231](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/231)

## Release 1.8.4 (September 22, 2017)
* Create a new completion service for each request.  
  This ensures that canceled tasks are discarded.  This will prevent a cancellation exception causing issues processing records.
  * [PR #227](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/227)
  * [Issue #226](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/226)

## Release 1.8.3 (September 22, 2017)
* Call shutdown on the retriever when the record processor is being shutdown  
  This fixes a bug that could leak threads if using the [`AsynchronousGetRecordsRetrievalStrategy`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/9a82b6bd05b3c9c5f8581af007141fa6d5f0fc4e/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/AsynchronousGetRecordsRetrievalStrategy.java#L42) is being used.  
  The asynchronous retriever is only used when [`KinesisClientLibConfiguration#retryGetRecordsInSeconds`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/01d2688bc6e68fd3fe5cb698cb65299d67ac930d/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L227), and [`KinesisClientLibConfiguration#maxGetRecordsThreadPool`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/01d2688bc6e68fd3fe5cb698cb65299d67ac930d/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/lib/worker/KinesisClientLibConfiguration.java#L230) are set.
  * [PR #222](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/222)

## Release 1.8.2 (September 20, 2017)
* Add support for two phase checkpoints  
  Applications can now set a pending checkpoint, before completing the checkpoint operation. Once the application has completed its checkpoint steps, the final checkpoint will clear the pending checkpoint.  
  Should the checkpoint fail the attempted sequence number is provided in the [`InitializationInput#getPendingCheckpointSequenceNumber`](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/clientlibrary/types/InitializationInput.java#L81) otherwise the value will be null.
  * [PR #188](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/188)
* Support timeouts, and retry for GetRecords calls.  
  Applications can now set timeouts for GetRecord calls to Kinesis.  As part of setting the timeout, the application must also provide a thread pool size for concurrent requests.
  * [PR #214](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/214)
* Notification when the lease table is throttled  
  When writes, or reads, to the lease table are throttled a warning will be emitted.  If you're seeing this warning you should increase the IOPs for your lease table to prevent processing delays.
  * [PR #212](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/212)
* Support configuring the graceful shutdown timeout for MultiLang Clients  
  This adds support for setting the timeout that the Java process will wait for the MutliLang client to complete graceful shutdown.  The timeout can be configured by adding `shutdownGraceMillis` to the properties file set to the number of milliseconds to wait.
  * [PR #204](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/204)

## Release 1.8.1 (August 2, 2017)
* Support timeouts for calls to the MultiLang Daemon
  This adds support for setting a timeout when dispatching records to the client record processor. If the record processor doesn't respond within the timeout the parent Java process will be terminated. This is a temporary fix to handle cases where the KCL becomes blocked while waiting for a client record processor.
  The timeout for the this can be set by adding `timeoutInSeconds = <timeout value>`. The default for this is no timeout.  
  __Setting this can cause the KCL to exit suddenly, before using this ensure that you have an automated restart for your application__
