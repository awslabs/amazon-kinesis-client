### Release 2.3.1 (October 20, 2020)
[Milestone#53](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/53)
* Introducing support for processing multiple kinesis data streams with the same KCL 2.x for java consumer application
  * To build a consumer application that can process multiple streams at the same time, you must implement a new
  interface called MultistreamTracker (https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/0c5042dadf794fe988438436252a5a8fe70b6b0b/amazon-kinesis-client/src/main/java/software/amazon/kinesis/processor/MultiStreamTracker.java)

  * MultistreamTracker will also publish various metrics around the current active streams being processed, the number
   of streams which are deleted at this time period or are pending deletion.


### Release 2.3.0 (August 17, 2020)
* [Milestone#52](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestones/52)

* Behavior of shard synchronization is moving from each worker independently learning about all existing shards to workers only discovering the children of shards that each worker owns. This optimizes memory usage, lease table IOPS usage, and number of calls made to kinesis for streams with high shard counts and/or frequent resharding.
* When bootstrapping an empty lease table, KCL utilizes the `ListShard` API's filtering option (the ShardFilter optional request parameter) to retrieve and create leases only for a snapshot of shards open at the time specified by the `ShardFilter` parameter. The `ShardFilter` parameter enables you to filter out the response of the `ListShards` API, using the `Type` parameter. KCL uses the `Type` filter parameter and the following of its valid values to identify and return a snapshot of open shards that might require new leases.
	* Currently, the following shard filters are supported:
		* `AT_TRIM_HORIZON` - the response includes all the shards that were open at `TRIM_HORIZON`.
		* `AT_LATEST` - the response includes only the currently open shards of the data stream.
	    * `AT_TIMESTAMP` - the response includes all shards whose start timestamp is less than or equal to the given timestamp and end timestamp is greater than or equal to the given timestamp or still open.
	* `ShardFilter` is used when creating leases for an empty lease table to initialize leases for a snapshot of shards specified at `RetrievalConfig#initialPositionInStreamExtended`.
	* For more information about ShardFilter, see the [official AWS documentation on ShardFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_ShardFilter.html).

* Introducing support for the `ChildShards` response of the `GetRecords` and the `SubscribeToShard` APIs to perform lease/shard synchronization that happens at `SHARD_END` for closed shards, allowing a KCL worker to only create leases for the child shards of the shard it finished processing.
	* For shared throughout consumer applications, this uses the `ChildShards` response of the `GetRecords` API. For dedicated throughput (enhanced fan-out) consumer applications, this uses the `ChildShards` response of the `SubscribeToShard` API.
	* For more information, see the official AWS Documentation on [GetRecords](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_GetRecords.html), [SubscribeToShard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_SubscribeToShard.html), and [ChildShard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_ChildShard.html).

* KCL now also performs additional periodic shard/lease scans in order to identify any potential holes in the lease table to ensure the complete hash range of the stream is being processed and create leases for them if required. `PeriodicShardSyncManager` is the new component that is responsible for running periodic lease/shard scans.
	* New configuration options are available to configure `PeriodicShardSyncManager` in `LeaseManagementConfig`

	| ----------------------------------------------------- | -----------------  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
	| leasesRecoveryAuditorExecutionFrequencyMillis         | 120000 (2 minutes) | Frequency (in millis) of the auditor job to scan for partial leases in the lease table. If the auditor detects any hole in the leases for a stream, then it would trigger shard sync based on leasesRecoveryAuditorInconsistencyConfidenceThreshold.          |
	| leasesRecoveryAuditorInconsistencyConfidenceThreshold | 3                  | Confidence threshold for the periodic auditor job to determine if leases for a stream in the lease table is inconsistent. If the auditor finds same set of inconsistencies consecutively for a stream for this many times, then it would trigger a shard sync |

	* New CloudWatch metrics are also now emitted to monitor the health of `PeriodicShardSyncManager`:

	| Name                        | Description                                            |
	| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
	| NumStreamsWithPartialLeases | Number of streams that had holes in their hash ranges. |
	| NumStreamsToSync            | Number of streams which underwent a full shard sync.   |

* Introducing deferred lease cleanup. Leases will be deleted asynchronously by `LeaseCleanupManager` upon reaching `SHARD_END`, when a shard has either expired past the stream’s retention period or been closed as the result of a resharding operation.
	* New configuration options are available to configure `LeaseCleanupManager`.

	| Name                                | Default    | Description                                                                                               |

	| completedLeaseCleanupIntervalMillis | 5 minutes  | Interval at which to check if a lease is completed or not.                                                |
	| garbageLeaseCleanupIntervalMillis   | 30 minutes | Interval at which to check if a lease is garbage (i.e trimmed past the stream's retention period) or not. |

  * `--properties-file`: Properties file that the KCL should use to set up the Scheduler.
  * `--log-configuration`: logback.xml that the KCL should use for logging.
* Updated AWS SDK dependency to 2.2.0.
* MultiLangDaemon now uses logback for logging.

### Release 2.0.5 (November 12, 2018)
[Milestone #26](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/26?closed=1)
* Fixed a deadlock condition that could occur when using the polling model.  
  When using the `PollingConfig` and a slower record processor it was possible to hit a deadlock in the retrieval of records. 
  * [PR #462](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/462)
  * [Issue #448](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/448)
* Adjusted `RetrievalConfig`, and `FanOutConfig` to use accessors instead of direct member access.  
  * [PR #453](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/453)


### Release 2.0.4 (October 18, 2018)
[Milestone #25](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/25)
* Added method to retrieve leases from the LeaseCoordinator and LeaseTaker.
  * [PR #428](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/428)
* Fixed a race condition shutting down the Scheduler before it has completed initialization.
  * [PR #439](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/439)
  * [Issue #427](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/427)
* Added `HierarchicalShardSyncer` which replaces the static `ShardSyncer`.  
  `HierarchicalShardSyncer` removes the contention between multiple instances of the Scheduler when running under a single JVM.
  * [PR #395](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/395)
  * [Issue #415](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/415)
* Added `TaskExecutionListener` which allows monitoring of tasks being executed by the `ShardConsumer`.  
  The listener is invoked before and after a task is executed by the `ShardConsumer`.
  * [PR #417](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/417)

### Release 2.0.3 (October 8, 2018)
[Milestone #23](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/23)
* Fixed an issue where the `KinesisAsyncClient` could be misconfigured to use HTTP 1.1.  
  Using HTTP 1.1 with `SubscribeToShard` is unsupported, and could cause misdelivery of records to the record processor.  
  * [Issue #391](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/391)
  * [PR #434](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/434)
  * [PR #433](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/433)
* Lower the severity of `ReadTimeout` exceptions.  
  `ReadTimeout` exceptions can occur if the client is unable to request data from Kinesis for more than client timeout, which defaults to 30 seconds.  This can occur if the record processor blocks for more than the timeout period.  `ReadTimeout` could also occur as part of [Issue #391](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/391).  
  * [Issue #399](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/399)
  * [PR #403](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/403)
* Added a callback that allows applications to take actions after DynamoDB table creation.

  * [PR #413](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/413)
* Updated the guava dependency to 26.0-jre.  
  * [PR #420](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/420)
  * [Issue #416](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/416)
* Added some additional debug logging around the initialization of the `FanOutRecordsPublisher`.  
  * [PR #398](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/398)
* Upgraded AWS SDK version to 2.0.6  
  * [PR #434](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/434)


### Release 2.0.2 (September 4, 2018)
[Milestone #22](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/milestone/22)
* Fixed an issue where the a warning would be logged every second if `logWarningForTaskAfterMillis` was set.  
  The logging for last time of data arrival now respects the value of `logWarningForTaskAfterMillis`.  
  * [PR #383](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/383)
  * [Issue #381](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/381)
* Moved creation of `WorkerStateChangedListener` and `GracefulShutdownCoordinator` to the `CoordinatorConfig`.
  Originally the `WorkerStateChangedListener` and `GracefulShutdownCoordinator` were created by methods on the `SchedulerCoordinatorFactory`, but they should have been configuration options.  
  The original methods have been deprecated, and may be removed at a later date.  
  * [PR #385](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/385)
  * [PR #388](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/388)
* Removed dependency on Apache Commons Lang 2.6.  
  The dependency on Apache Commons Lang 2.6 has removed, and all usages updated to use Apache Commons Lang 3.7.  
  * [PR #386](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/386)
  * [Issue #370](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/issues/370)
* Fixed a typo in the MutliLang Daemon shutdown hook.  
  * [PR #387](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/387)
* Added method `onAllInitializationAttemptsFailed(Throwable)` to `WorkerStateChangedListener` to report when all initialization attempts have failed.  
  This method is a default method, and it isn't require to implement the method. This method is only called after all attempts to initialize the `Scheduler` have failed.
  * [PR #369](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/369)

### Release 2.0.1 (August 21, 2018)
* Mark certain internal components with `@KinesisClientInternalApi` attribute.  
  Components marked as internal may be deprecated at a faster rate than public components.  
  * [PR #358](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/358)
* Fixed an issue where `ResourceNotFoundException` on subscription to a shard was not triggering end of shard handling.  
  If a lease table contains a shard that is no longer present in the stream attempt to subscribe to that shard will trigger a `ResourceNotFoundException`. These exception are treated the same as reaching the end of a shard.
  * [PR #359](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/359)
* Fixed an issue where the KCL would not Use the configured DynamoDB IOPs when creating the lease table.  
  * [PR #360](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/360)
* Make the maximum number of Scheduler initialization attempts configurable.  
  The maximum number of `Scheduler` initialization attempts can be configured via `CoordinatorConfig#maxInitializationAttempts`.
  * [PR #363](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/363)
  * [PR #368](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/368)
* Fixed an issue where it was possible to get a duplicate record when resubscribing to a shard.  
  Subscribe to shard requires periodic resubscribing, and uses a new concept of a continuation sequence number.  If the continuation sequence number was equal to the last record that record would be processed a second time.  Resubscribing now uses `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to ensure that only later records are returned.  
  * [PR #371](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/371)
* Upgraded to AWS SDK 2.0.1  
  * [PR #372](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/372)
* Fixed an issue where time based restart of the subscription wasn't resetting the `lastRequestTime`.  
  If a subscription hasn't delivered any data for more than 30 seconds it will be canceled and restarted.  This detection is based of the `lastRequestTime` which wasn't getting reset after the restart was triggered.
  * [PR #373](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/373)
* Fixed an issue where requesting on the subscription from the `FanOutRecordsPublisher` could trigger an unexpected failure.  
  Due to a race condition the underlying flow in the subscription could be set to something else.  The method is now synchronized, and verifies that the subscriber it was created with is still the subscriber in affect.  
  This issue generally would only appear when multiple errors were occurring while connecting to Kinesis.
  * [PR #374](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/374)
* Fixed an issue where the number of requested items could exceed the capacity of the RxJava queue.  
  There was an off by one issue when determining whether to make a request to the SDK subscription.  This changes the calculation to represent the capacity as a queue.
  * [PR #375](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client/pull/375)

### Release 2.0.0 (August 02, 2018)
* The Maven `groupId`, along with the `version`, for the Amazon Kinesis Client has changed from `com.amazonaws` to `software.amazon.kinesis`.  
  To add a dependency on the new version of the Amazon Kinesis Client:  
  ``` xml
  <dependency>
      <groupId>software.amazon.kinesis</groupId>
      <artifactId>amazon-kinesis-client</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
* Added support for Enhanced Fan Out.  
  Enhanced Fan Out provides for lower end to end latency, and increased number of consumers per stream. 
  * Records are now delivered via streaming, reducing end-to-end latency.
  * The Amazon Kinesis Client will automatically register a new consumer if required.  
    When registering a new consumer, the Kinesis Client will default to the application name unless configured otherwise.
  * `SubscribeToShard` maintains long lived connections with Kinesis, which in the AWS Java SDK 2.0 is limited by default.  
    The `KinesisClientUtil` has been added to assist configuring the `maxConcurrency` of the `KinesisAsyncClient`.   
    __WARNING: The Amazon Kinesis Client may see significantly increased latency, unless the `KinesisAsyncClient` is configured to have a `maxConcurrency` high enough to allow all leases plus additional usages of the `KinesisAsyncClient`.__
  * The Amazon Kinesis Client now uses 3 additional Kinesis API's:  
    __WARNING: If using a restrictive Kinesis IAM policy you may need to add the following API methods to the policy.__  
    * [`SubscribeToShard`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_SubscribeToShard.html)
    * [`DescribeStreamSummary`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeStreamSummary.html)
    * [`DescribeStreamConsumer`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeStreamConsumer.html)
    * [`RegisterStreamConsumer`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterStreamConsumer.html)
  * New configuration options are available to configure Enhanced Fan Out.

  |-----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | consumerArn     | Unset   | The ARN for an already created consumer.  If this is set, the Kinesis Client will not attempt to create a consumer. |
  | streamName      | Unset   | The name of the stream that a consumer should be create for if necessary                                            |
  | consumerName    | Unset   | The name of the consumer to create.  If this is not set the applicationName will be used instead.                   |
  | applicationName | Unset   | The name of the application.  This is used as the name of the consumer unless consumerName is set.                  |

* Modular Configuration of the Kinesis Client
  The Kinesis Client has migrated to a modular configuration system, and the `KinesisClientLibConfiguration` class has been removed.  
  Configuration has been split into 7 classes.  Default versions of the configuration can be created from the `ConfigsBuilder`.  
  Please [see the migration guide for more information][migration-guide].
  * `CheckpointConfig`
  * `CoordinatorConfig`
  * `LeaseManagementConfig`
  * `LifecycleConfig`
  * `MetricsConfig`
  * `ProcessorConfig`
  * `RetrievalConfig`

* Upgraded to AWS Java SDK 2.0  
  The Kinesis Client now uses the AWS Java SDK 2.0.  The dependency on AWS Java SDK 1.11 has been removed. 
  All configurations will only accept 2.0 clients.  
  * When configuring the `KinesisAsyncClient` the `KinesisClientUtil#createKinesisAsyncClient` can be used to configure the Kinesis Client 
  * __If you need support for AWS Java SDK 1.11 you will need to add a direct dependency.__  
    __When adding a dependency you must ensure that the 1.11 versions of Jackson dependencies are excluded__  
    [Please see the migration guide for more information][migration-guide]
    
* MultiLangDaemon is now a separate module  
  The MultiLangDaemon has been separated to its own Maven module and is no longer available in `amazon-kinesis-client`.  To include the MultiLangDaemon, add a dependency on `amazon-kinesis-client-multilang`.
